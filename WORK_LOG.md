Our algorithm works for the first test case, but for the others, it returns a value higher than the expected by anywhere from a couple dozen to a few hundred. |
| Feb 25 | 5:45-6:15pm  | I added an if statement to make sure we are limiting the length of the substring in the 2D array to what is possible with our document lengths. Still, that didn't fix the problem. I tried looking through my code to identify any more logic errors, but I couldn't find any. I think I need to get another set of eyes on my code. |
