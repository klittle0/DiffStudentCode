Our algorithm works for the first test case, but for the others, it returns a value higher than the expected by anywhere from a couple dozen to a few hundred. |

Still, that didn't fix the problem. I tried looking through my code to identify any more logic errors, but I couldn't find any. I think I need to get another set of eyes on my code. |
| Feb 27 | 9:00-10:00am | I talked to Liliana about how our algorithm might be overestimating the length of the shared substring. She came up with an idea to look diagonal, up and to the left, when the current two chars that are being compared are equal. I implemented this into my program, and now all of the test cases work pretty quickly. We also went to the board to write a test problem so we could figure out why this works for this problem. |
